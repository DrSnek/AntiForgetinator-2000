# AntiForgetinator-2000

The Antiforget-Inator 2000 was designed to provide a streamlined, easy-to-use interface for patients with Dementia and Alzheimer's. It allows users to speak into the interface to plan, schedule, and remember activities, as well as showing them all pending tasks. 

  Using a simple command line interface, it is simple with no visually distracting elements providing the most ergonomic and convenient experience ever.
